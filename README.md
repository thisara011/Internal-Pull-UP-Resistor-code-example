# Internal-Pull-UP-Resistor-code-example
In this example, the buttonPin is configured with an internal pull-up resistor using INPUT_PULLUP in the pinMode function. The button state is then read, and if the button is pressed, the LED on pin 13 is turned ON, and a message is printed to the Serial Monitor. When the button is released, the LED is turned OFF, and another message is printed.
